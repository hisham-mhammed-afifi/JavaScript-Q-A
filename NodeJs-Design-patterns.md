### All chapters:

**1. Node.js, Callbacks, and Events**
Chapter 1 introduces the fundamental concepts of Node.js, such as the event-driven and non-blocking nature of its I/O operations. It explains how Node.js uses callbacks and events to manage asynchronous operations and how they differ from the traditional synchronous programming model.

The chapter starts by giving an overview of the Node.js architecture, explaining its core modules and how they interact with each other. It then goes on to explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution and why Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

The chapter also covers the role of callbacks and how they are used in Node.js. It explains that callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when an asynchronous operation is complete. The chapter provides examples of using callbacks in Node.js, such as reading and writing files, making HTTP requests, and working with databases.

Next, the chapter discusses the EventEmitter class, which is a core Node.js module that allows developers to create and manage custom events. It explains how to use the EventEmitter class to create and emit events, as well as how to register listeners to handle those events.

**2. Callbacks and Error Handling**
The chapter starts by explaining how to define and use callbacks with multiple arguments, as well as how to pass context (i.e., `this` ) to the callback function. It also covers the concept of error-first callbacks, which is a convention in Node.js for handling errors in asynchronous operations. In this convention, the first argument passed to a callback function is always an error object, which is null if no error occurred.

**1. Hoisting:** Use Case: Hoisting allows you to use functions or variables before they are declared.

```js
// Example
console.log(message); // Output: undefined
var message = "Hello!";
```

In this example, the `message` variable is hoisted to the top, but its value is `undefined` until the assignment statement is reached.
**2. `null` vs. `undefined`:** Use Case: Differentiating intentional absence (`null`) from uninitialized or missing value (`undefined`).

```js
// Example
let name = null; // Explicitly set to null to indicate absence
let age; // Implicitly undefined since no value is assigned
console.log(name); // Output: null
console.log(age); // Output: undefined
```

Here, `name` is set to `null` to indicate that there is no name available, while `age` is undefined because it hasn't been assigned a value.
**3. Closures: Use Case:** Closures are useful for data encapsulation and creating private variables.

```js
// Example
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment: function () {
      count++;
    },
    getCount: function () {
      return count;
    },
  };
}
const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // Output: 1
```

In this example, the `createCounter` function returns an object with two methods: `increment` and `getCount`. The `count` variable is enclosed within the returned object, creating a closure that allows accessing and modifying the `count` variable.
**4. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous programming:** Use Case: Asynchronous programming is essential for handling time-consuming operations without blocking the main execution thread.

```js
// Example
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async operation");
}, 2000);
console.log("End");
```

In this example, the `setTimeout` function is used to simulate an asynchronous operation that will execute after 2 seconds. While the timer is running, the program continues executing the rest of the code, resulting in "Start" and "End" being logged before the "Async operation".
**5. Event loop: Use Case:** The event loop handles asynchronous operations and ensures the responsive and non-blocking nature of JavaScript.

```js
// Example
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async operation");
}, 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise resolved");
});
console.log("End");
```

In this example, `setTimeout` and `Promise.resolve().then()` are queued in the event loop for execution. Even though the timeout is set to 0 milliseconds, the "Async operation" will be logged after "Promise resolved" due to the event loop's order of execution.
**6. `let`, `const`, and `var`:** Use Case: Choosing the appropriate variable declaration based on scope and mutability requirements.

```js
// Example
function example() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 5; // Function-scoped variable
    let y = 10; // Block-scoped variable
    const z = 15; // Block-scoped constant
    console.log(x, y, z); // Output: 5 10 15
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 5
  console.log(y); // Throws ReferenceError: y is not defined
  console.log(z); // Throws ReferenceError: z is not defined
}
example();
```

In this example, `var` declares a variable that is function-scoped, allowing it to be accessed outside the `if` block. However, `let` and `const` are block-scoped and can only be accessed within their respective blocks.
**7. Shallow copy vs. Deep copy:** Use Case: Copying objects or arrays while maintaining data integrity and avoiding unintended mutations.

```js
// Example - Shallow Copy
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const shallowCopy = originalArray;
shallowCopy.push(4);
console.log(originalArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(shallowCopy); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, the `shallowCopy` variable references the same array as `originalArray`. Modifying `shallowCopy` also affects `originalArray` because they point to the same reference in memory.

```js
// Example - Deep Copy
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const deepCopy = [...originalArray];
deepCopy.push(4);
console.log(originalArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
console.log(deepCopy); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, the spread operator (`...`) creates a new array with the same values as `originalArray`. Modifying `deepCopy` does not affect `originalArray` since they are separate arrays in memory.
**8. `this` keyword:** Use Case: Understanding the dynamic context of `this` based on how a function is called.

```js
// Example
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  },
};
const greet = person.greet;
greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined
const boundGreet = person.greet.bind(person);
boundGreet(); // Output: Hello, John!
```

In this example, when `greet` is called directly, the `this` keyword refers to the global object (in non-strict mode), resulting in `undefined` for `this.name`. However, using `bind` explicitly binds the `person` object as the `this` value, allowing the correct name to be logged.
**9. `==` vs. `===`:** Use Case: Comparing values for equality and understanding the differences in coercion behavior.

```js
// Example
console.log(5 == "5"); // Output: true
console.log(5 === "5"); // Output: false
```

In JavaScript, `==` performs type coercion before comparison, allowing different types to be considered equal if their values match. However, `===` performs a strict equality comparison, checking for both value and type.
**10. Data types in JavaScript:** Use Case: Identifying and working with different types of data.

```js
// Example
const age = 30; // number
const name = "John"; // string
const isStudent = true; // boolean
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 }; // object
const greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello!");
}; // function
let value; // undefined
const empty = null; // null
console.log(typeof age); // Output: number
console.log(typeof name); // Output: string
console.log(typeof isStudent); // Output: boolean
console.log(typeof person); // Output: object
console.log(typeof greet); // Output: function
console.log(typeof value); // Output: undefined
console.log(typeof empty); // Output: object
```

In this example, various data types in JavaScript are assigned to different variables, and the `typeof` operator is used to determine their types.
**11. Event delegation:** Use Case: Efficiently handling events on dynamically added elements or child elements within a parent container.

```js
// Example
const parentContainer = document.getElementById("parent");
parentContainer.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "BUTTON") {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  }
});
```

In this example, instead of attaching individual event listeners to each button element, a single event listener is attached to the parent container. The event is then delegated to the appropriate button element based on the target of the event.
**12. Callback functions:** Use Case: Handling asynchronous operations or executing code after a specific event or task completes.

```js
// Example
function fetchData(url, callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous request
  setTimeout(function () {
    const data = { name: "John", age: 30 };
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}
function processData(data) {
  console.log(`Processing data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
}
fetchData("https://api.example.com/data", processData);
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function performs an asynchronous request and accepts a callback function as an argument. Once the data is fetched, the callback function `processData` is invoked with the retrieved data as its argument.
**13. `bind` method:** Use Case: Setting the `this` value explicitly for a function or creating partially applied functions.

```js
// Example
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function (message) {
    console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`);
  },
};
const greet = person.greet;
greet("Hello"); // Output: undefined, Hello!
const boundGreet = person.greet.bind(person, "Hi");
boundGreet(); // Output: Hi, John!
```

In this example, the `greet` function is initially assigned to `greet`, causing the `this` value to become `undefined`. However, using `bind` to bind `person` as the `this` value and provide the message argument creates a new function `boundGreet` that logs the desired greeting.
**14. Lexical scoping:** Use Case: Resolving variable names based on their placement in the source code and scoping rules.

```js
// Example
function outer() {
  const x = 10;
  function inner() {
    const x = 20;
    console.log(x); // Output: 20
  }
  inner();
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
}
outer();
```

In this example, the `inner` function has its own `x` variable, which shadows the `x` variable in the outer function. The concept of lexical scoping allows accessing the inner `x` within the `inner` function, while the outer `x` remains unaffected.
**15. `map` method:** Use Case: Transforming elements of an array to create a new array.

```js
// Example
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(function (num) {
  return num * num;
});
console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, the `map` method is used to transform each element of the `numbers` array by squaring it. The resulting array, `squaredNumbers`, contains the squared values of the original numbers.
**16. Promises:** Use Case: Handling asynchronous operations and chaining multiple operations.

```js
// Example
function fetchData(url) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    // Simulating an asynchronous request
    setTimeout(function () {
      const data = { name: "John", age: 30 };
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
}
function processData(data) {
  console.log(`Processing data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
}
fetchData("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then(processData)
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
  });
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function returns a Promise that resolves with the fetched data. The `processData` function is then called with the resolved data using the `then` method. If any errors occur during the Promise chain, they are caught and logged using the `catch` method.
**17. Arrow functions:** Use Case: Writing concise function expressions and avoiding the need for `this` binding.

```js
// Example
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the arrow function syntax is used to create a concise function expression that doubles each element of the `numbers` array, resulting in the `doubledNumbers` array.
**18. `apply` and `call` methods:** Use Case: Invoking a function with a specific `this` value and arguments.

```js
// Example
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function (message) {
    console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`);
  },
};
function greet(message) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`);
}
greet.call(person, "Hello"); // Output: Hello, John!
greet.apply(person, ["Hi"]); // Output: Hi, John!
```

In this example, the `call` and `apply` methods are used to invoke the `greet` function with `person` as the `this` value and "Hello" and "Hi" as the respective message arguments.
**19. `forEach` method:** Use Case: Iterating over an array and performing an operation on each element.

```js
// Example
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(function (num) {
  console.log(num * 2);
});
// Output:
// 2
// 4
// 6
// 8
// 10
```

In this example, the `forEach` method is used to iterate over each element of the `numbers` array and log its double.
**20. `localStorage` vs. `sessionStorage`:** Use Case: Storing data in the browser and understanding the differences in data persistence.

```js
// Example
localStorage.setItem("name", "John");
sessionStorage.setItem("age", "30");
const storedName = localStorage.getItem("name");
const storedAge = sessionStorage.getItem("age");
console.log(storedName); // Output: John
console.log(storedAge); // Output: 30
```

In this example, data is stored in both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` using the `setItem` method. The `getItem` method is then used to retrieve the stored data. `localStorage` stores data that persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, while `sessionStorage` stores data that persists only within the same session.

# Angular

**1. What is Angular Ivy and how does it improve the Angular framework?**
Answer: Angular Ivy is the new rendering engine introduced in Angular 9. It provides enhanced bundle size reduction, improved build times, and better runtime performance. Ivy introduces features like selective rendering, improved tree shaking, and template type checking. It allows for faster rendering of components and better error messages during compilation.

**2. Explain the concept of Angular change detection and how it works.**
Answer: Angular uses change detection to track changes in component properties and update the view accordingly. Change detection is triggered automatically whenever an event occurs (e.g., user interaction) or when data changes. Angular uses a hierarchical tree structure to efficiently detect and propagate changes. It follows a top-down approach starting from the root component and traverses the component tree. Angular checks the component's properties for changes and updates the corresponding parts of the view.

**3. What are Angular reactive forms and how are they different from template-driven forms?**
Answer: Angular reactive forms provide a model-driven approach for handling forms in Angular. It involves creating form controls programmatically and binding them to the component's properties. Reactive forms offer more flexibility and control over form validation and complex form scenarios. In contrast, template-driven forms rely on directives in the HTML template for form handling and validation. Reactive forms are generally recommended for complex forms with dynamic behavior and custom validation requirements.

**4. Explain the concept of lazy loading in Angular and how it improves application performance.**
Answer: Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows modules to be loaded on-demand as the user navigates through the application. By loading modules only when needed, lazy loading reduces the initial bundle size and improves application startup time. Lazy loading is achieved using Angular's routing system, where specific routes are configured to load modules asynchronously. This technique is especially useful for large applications with multiple feature modules, as it avoids loading unnecessary code upfront.

**5. How would you implement authentication and authorization in an Angular application?**
Answer: Implementing authentication and authorization in an Angular application involves several steps:

- Setting up a login page and capturing user credentials.
- Sending the credentials to an authentication server for verification.
- Storing the authentication token (e.g., JWT) in local storage or a cookie.
- Implementing an authentication service to manage user login status and token storage.
- Using Angular route guards to protect routes that require authentication.
- Checking the user's authorization level before allowing access to certain features or resources.
  Example: Here's an example of an authentication service in Angular:

```ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  private isLoggedIn = false;

  login(username: string, password: string): boolean {
    // Perform authentication logic here (e.g., API call)
    if (username === "admin" && password === "password") {
      // Store the authentication token
      localStorage.setItem("token", "your-auth-token");
      this.isLoggedIn = true;
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  logout(): void {
    // Remove the authentication token
    localStorage.removeItem("token");
    this.isLoggedIn = false;
  }

  isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    // Check if the user is logged in
    return this.isLoggedIn;
  }
}
```

**6. Explain the concept of Angular interceptors and provide an example of their usage.**
Answer: Angular interceptors are classes that can intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses. They provide a way to add global error handling, authentication headers, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns to HTTP requests. Interceptors implement the `HttpInterceptor` interface and can be added to the `HTTP_INTERCEPTORS` multi-provider.
Example: Here's an example of an interceptor that adds an authentication header to each outgoing request:

```ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import {
  HttpInterceptor,
  HttpRequest,
  HttpHandler,
  HttpEvent,
} from "@angular/common/http";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(
    request: HttpRequest<any>,
    next: HttpHandler
  ): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    // Add authentication token to the request header
    const authToken = localStorage.getItem("token");
    if (authToken) {
      request = request.clone({
        setHeaders: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`,
        },
      });
    }

    return next.handle(request);
  }
}
```

To use the interceptor, provide it in the Angular module:

```ts
import { HttpClientModule, HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from "@angular/common/http";
import { AuthInterceptor } from "./auth.interceptor";

@NgModule({
  imports: [HttpClientModule],
  providers: [
    { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthInterceptor, multi: true },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**7. How would you handle form validation and error handling in Angular reactive forms?**
Answer: Angular provides various techniques for form validation and error handling in reactive forms:

- Using built-in validators such as `required`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, etc.
- Creating custom validators using the `Validators` class.
- Adding validation directives like `ngModel`, `ngModelGroup`, and `ngForm`.
- Displaying error messages using the `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `FormArray` API.
- Using the `ngClass` or `ngStyle` directives to conditionally apply CSS classes or styles based on form validation status.
  Example: Here's an example of form validation and error handling in Angular reactive forms:

```html
<form [formGroup]="myForm">
  <input type="text" formControlName="name" required />
  <div *ngIf="myForm.get('name').errors?.required">Name is required.</div>

  <input type="email" formControlName="email" [pattern]="emailPattern" />
  <div *ngIf="myForm.get('email').errors?.pattern">Invalid email format.</div>

  <button type="submit" [disabled]="myForm.invalid">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { FormBuilder, Validators } from "@angular/forms";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-form",
  templateUrl: "./my-form.component.html",
})
export class MyFormComponent {
  myForm = this.formBuilder.group({
    name: ["", Validators.required],
    email: [
      "",
      [
        Validators.required,
        Validators.pattern("^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$"),
      ],
    ],
  });

  get emailPattern() {
    return this.myForm.get("email").errors?.pattern?.requiredPattern;
  }
}
```

**8. What are Angular guards and how would you use them?**
Answer: Angular guards are used to protect routes and control access to certain parts of an application. There are four types of guards: `CanActivate`, `CanActivateChild`, `CanDeactivate`, and `CanLoad`.

- `CanActivate` guard is used to allow or deny access to a route.
- `CanActivateChild` guard is used to allow or deny access to child routes.
- `CanDeactivate` guard is used to prevent navigation away from a route.
- `CanLoad` guard is used to conditionally load feature modules based on authentication or authorization.
  Example: Here's an example of using `CanActivate` guard to protect a route:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, UrlTree, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
constructor(private router: Router) { }

canActivate(
next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
state: RouterStateSnapshot
): Observable<boolean | UrlTree> | Promise<boolean | UrlTree> | boolean | UrlTree {
// Check if user is authenticated
const isAuthenticated = // logic to check if user is authenticated

if (isAuthenticated) {
return true;
} else {
// Redirect to login page
return this.router.parseUrl('/login');
}
}
}
```

To use the guard, provide it in the Angular module:

```ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { RouterModule, Routes } from "@angular/router";
import { AuthGuard } from "./auth.guard";

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "protected",
    component: ProtectedComponent,
    canActivate: [AuthGuard],
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
  providers: [AuthGuard],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

**9. How would you optimize an Angular application for performance?**
Answer: There are several techniques to optimize Angular application performance:

- Use lazy loading to load modules on-demand and reduce initial bundle size.
- Optimize the size of the application bundle by enabling production mode and using AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation.
- Use Angular CLI build optimization options like `--prod` and `--build-optimizer`.
- Implement server-side rendering (Angular Universal) to improve initial rendering speed.
- Optimize change detection by using `OnPush` change detection strategy and immutable data.
- Minimize the use of Angular bindings and directives in performance-critical sections.
- Implement lazy-loaded image loading techniques to load images only when they are visible on the screen.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms for data manipulation and rendering.
- Use observables and reactive programming to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.
  These techniques, combined with good coding practices and profiling tools like Angular DevTools, can significantly improve the performance of an Angular application.

**10. How do you handle communication between components in Angular?**
Answer: Angular provides several mechanisms for communication between components:

- Parent-to-child communication: This can be achieved through property binding and input properties. The parent component can pass data to the child component using property bindings and the `@Input` decorator.
- Child-to-parent communication: This can be achieved through event binding and output properties. The child component can emit events using the `EventEmitter` and `@Output` decorator, which can be subscribed to by the parent component.
- Sharing data between unrelated components: This can be done using a shared service. The shared service acts as a mediator between components and holds the shared data that can be accessed and updated by multiple components.
- Communication between sibling components: This can be done through a common parent component or by using a shared service.
  Example: Here's an example of parent-to-child and child-to-parent communication:

```ts
// parent.component.ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-parent",
  template: `
    <app-child
      [message]="parentMessage"
      (onChildEvent)="handleChildEvent($event)"
    ></app-child>
  `,
})
export class ParentComponent {
  parentMessage = "Message from parent";

  handleChildEvent(event: string): void {
    console.log("Event from child:", event);
  }
}

// child.component.ts
import { Component, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: `
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
    <button (click)="sendMessage()">Send Message</button>
  `,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() message: string;
  @Output() onChildEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();

  sendMessage(): void {
    this.onChildEvent.emit("Event from child");
  }
}
```

In this example, the parent component passes the `message` property to the child component using property binding. The child component displays the message and emits an event when the button is clicked. The parent component handles the event and logs the received event. This demonstrates parent-to-child and child-to-parent communication in Angular.

**11. Explain the concept of Angular content projection (ng-content) and provide an example of its usage.**
Answer: Angular content projection allows you to pass content from a parent component to a child component, enabling flexible component composition. It is achieved using the `<ng-content>` directive. The content placed between the opening and closing tags of the child component is projected into the designated area within the child component's template.
Example:

```html
<!-- parent.component.html -->
<app-child>
  <h2>Content projected from parent component</h2>
  <p>This content will be displayed inside the child component.</p>
</app-child>
```

```html
<!-- child.component.html -->
<div class="child-container">
  <h1>Child Component</h1>
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
```

In this example, the content between the `<app-child>` tags in the parent component will be projected into the `<ng-content></ng-content>` area within the child component's template. When rendered, the resulting HTML will be:

```html
<div class="child-container">
  <h1>Child Component</h1>
  <h2>Content projected from parent component</h2>
  <p>This content will be displayed inside the child component.</p>
</div>
```

**12. Explain the concept of Angular component life cycle hooks and provide examples of their usage.**
Answer: Angular component life cycle hooks are methods that allow you to tap into specific moments in the life cycle of a component. They provide opportunities to perform actions during different stages, such as initialization, change detection, and destruction of a component.
Example:

```ts
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-component",
  template: "...",
})
export class MyComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Initialization logic
    console.log("Component initialized");
  }

  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    // Cleanup logic
    console.log("Component destroyed");
  }
}
```

In this example, the `OnInit` interface is implemented to use the `ngOnInit` method, which is called when the component is initialized. It is a good place to perform initialization tasks, such as retrieving data from a server.
The `OnDestroy` interface is implemented to use the `ngOnDestroy` method, which is called just before the component is destroyed. It is useful for cleaning up resources, such as unsubscribing from observables, to prevent memory leaks.

**13. What are Angular pipes and how would you create a custom pipe?**
Answer: Angular pipes are a way to transform data within templates. They are used to format and manipulate data before displaying it in the view. Angular provides built-in pipes such as `DatePipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe`, etc.
To create a custom pipe, you can use the `@Pipe` decorator and implement the `PipeTransform` interface.
Example:

```ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from "@angular/core";

@Pipe({
  name: "myCustomPipe",
})
export class MyCustomPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    // Custom transformation logic
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

In this example, a custom pipe called `myCustomPipe` is created. It takes a value as input and transforms it to uppercase using the `transform` method. The pipe can then be used in templates like this:

```html
<p>{{ 'hello world' | myCustomPipe }}</p>
```

The output will be:

```html
<p>HELLO WORLD</p>
```

**14. How would you implement data sharing between sibling components in Angular?**
Answer: To implement data sharing between sibling components, you can use a shared service as a mediator. The shared service holds the data that needs to be shared between components, and the components can access and update the data through the service.
Example:

```ts
// shared-data.service.ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { Subject } from "rxjs";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: "root",
})
export class SharedDataService {
  private dataSubject = new Subject<string>();
  data$ = this.dataSubject.asObservable();

  sendData(data: string): void {
    this.dataSubject.next(data);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `SharedDataService` provides a `data$` observable and a `sendData` method. The `sendData` method emits the data through the `dataSubject`.

```ts
// sibling-a.component.ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { SharedDataService } from "../shared-data.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-sibling-a",
  template: ` <input [(ngModel)]="data" (ngModelChange)="sendData()" /> `,
})
export class SiblingAComponent {
  data = "";

  constructor(private sharedDataService: SharedDataService) {}

  sendData(): void {
    this.sharedDataService.sendData(this.data);
  }
}
```

```ts
// sibling-b.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { SharedDataService } from "../shared-data.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-sibling-b",
  template: ` <p>Data from Sibling A: {{ receivedData }}</p> `,
})
export class SiblingBComponent implements OnInit {
  receivedData = "";

  constructor(private sharedDataService: SharedDataService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.sharedDataService.data$.subscribe((data) => {
      this.receivedData = data;
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, `SiblingAComponent` updates the `data` property and calls the `sendData` method to send the data through the shared service. `SiblingBComponent` subscribes to the `data$` observable and updates the `receivedData` property whenever new data is received.

**15. How would you handle asynchronous operations in Angular?**
Answer: Angular provides several mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations:

- Promises: Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations that will eventually resolve with a value or fail with an error. They can be used with the `then` and `catch` methods to handle success and failure cases respectively.
  Example:

```ts
asyncFunction()
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle success
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle error
  });
```

- Observables: Observables are a more powerful and flexible approach for handling asynchronous operations. They can emit multiple values over time and provide a rich set of operators to transform, filter, and combine data.
  Example:

```ts
observableFunction().subscribe(
  (result) => {
    // Handle emitted values
  },
  (error) => {
    // Handle error
  },
  () => {
    // Handle completion
  }
);
```

- Async/Await: Async/await is a modern approach to handle asynchronous operations in a synchronous-looking way. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
  Example:

```ts
async function fetchData(): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const result = await asyncFunction();
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

These are some of the ways to handle asynchronous operations in Angular. The choice of approach depends on the specific use case and requirements of your application.

**16. How does Angular change detection work? Explain the default change detection strategy and the OnPush change detection strategy.**
Answer: Angular change detection is a mechanism that determines when and how to update the view based on changes in the application state. It tracks changes to properties and data bindings of components and their child components.

- Default Change Detection Strategy: In the default change detection strategy, Angular automatically detects changes by running change detection on all components in the application's view tree. It does so by periodically checking all the bindings and updating the view accordingly. Any change in the component's properties or data bindings triggers a cascade of change detection across the component tree.
- OnPush Change Detection Strategy: The OnPush change detection strategy is an optimization technique that reduces the number of change detection cycles by making components dependent only on their inputs and the outputs of pure functions. It allows components to skip change detection if their inputs haven't changed. This strategy can significantly improve the performance of an application.

**17. How would you handle form validation in Angular? Provide an example.**
Answer: Angular provides built-in form validation features that allow you to validate user input and provide feedback. Here's an example of handling form validation in Angular:

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { FormGroup, FormControl, Validators } from "@angular/forms";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-form",
  template: `
    <form [formGroup]="myForm" (ngSubmit)="submitForm()">
      <input type="text" formControlName="name" />
      <div *ngIf="name.invalid && (name.dirty || name.touched)">
        <div *ngIf="name.errors.required">Name is required.</div>
        <div *ngIf="name.errors.minlength">
          Name must be at least 3 characters long.
        </div>
      </div>
      <button type="submit" [disabled]="myForm.invalid">Submit</button>
    </form>
  `,
})
export class MyFormComponent {
  myForm: FormGroup;

  constructor() {
    this.myForm = new FormGroup({
      name: new FormControl("", [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(3)]),
    });
  }

  submitForm(): void {
    if (this.myForm.valid) {
      // Form submission logic
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a reactive form using the `FormGroup` and `FormControl` classes. The `name` form control is defined with validation rules using `Validators.required` and `Validators.minLength(3)`.
In the template, we bind the form group to the `<form>` element using `[formGroup]="myForm"`. We bind the `name` form control to the `<input>` element using `formControlName="name"`. We display validation errors based on the control's state using `*ngIf` directives.
The submit button is disabled when the form is invalid using `[disabled]="myForm.invalid"`. In the `submitForm` method, we check if the form is valid before performing form submission logic.

**18. How would you implement lazy loading in Angular? Provide an example.**
Answer: Lazy loading in Angular allows you to load feature modules on-demand, reducing the initial bundle size and improving application performance. Here's an example of implementing lazy loading in Angular:

```ts
// app-routing.module.ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { RouterModule, Routes } from "@angular/router";

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "home",
    loadChildren: () => import("./home/home.module").then((m) => m.HomeModule),
  },
  {
    path: "dashboard",
    loadChildren: () =>
      import("./dashboard/dashboard.module").then((m) => m.DashboardModule),
  },
  // Other routes...
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

In this example, the `AppRoutingModule` defines the routes for the application. Each route is configured with the `loadChildren` property, which is a function that dynamically loads the corresponding module using the `import()` function. The module is then specified using the `then` method.

```ts
// home.module.ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";
import { HomeComponent } from "./home.component";
import { RouterModule, Routes } from "@angular/router";

const routes: Routes = [{ path: "", component: HomeComponent }];

@NgModule({
  declarations: [HomeComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule, RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
})
export class HomeModule {}
```

In the lazy-loaded module (e.g., `HomeModule`), you define the module-specific routes and components. The module is imported using the `import()` function and the module's routes are configured using `RouterModule.forChild()`.
With lazy loading configured, the corresponding module and its associated resources (e.g., components, services) will be loaded only when the user navigates to the specified route.

**19. How would you handle HTTP requests in Angular? Provide an example using the HttpClient module.**
Answer: In Angular, you can handle HTTP requests using the `HttpClient` module, which provides a simplified API for making HTTP requests. Here's an example:

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";

@Component({
  selector: "app-my-component",
  template: `
    <button (click)="getData()">Get Data</button>
    <div *ngIf="data">
      <p>{{ data }}</p>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class MyComponent {
  data: any;

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getData(): void {
    this.http.get("https://api.example.com/data").subscribe((response) => {
      this.data = response;
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, we import the `HttpClient` module from `@angular/common/http`. In the component's `getData` method, we use the `http.get` method to make a GET request to the specified URL ('[https://api.example.com/data](https://api.example.com/data)').
We subscribe to the observable returned by `http.get` and handle the response data in the callback function. In this case, we assign the response data to the `data` property, which is then displayed in the template.
Note that you need to import and configure the `HttpClientModule` in your root or feature module to use the `HttpClient` module. You can do this by adding it to the `imports` array of the module's decorator.

**20. How would you implement route guards in Angular? Provide an example of a route guard.**
Answer: Route guards in Angular allow you to control access to routes based on certain conditions. They can be used to implement authentication, authorization, and other access control mechanisms. Here's an example of implementing a route guard:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, Router } from '@angular/router';

@Injectable({
providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
constructor(private router: Router) {}

canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean {
		// Check if the user is authenticated
		const isAuthenticated = /* Your authentication logic here */;

		if (isAuthenticated) {
			return true;
		} else {
			// Redirect to the login page
			this.router.navigate(['/login']);
			return false;
		}
	}
}
```

In this example, we define an `AuthGuard` that implements the `CanActivate` interface. The `canActivate` method is called when the associated route is activated.
Inside the `canActivate` method, you can implement your authentication logic. If the user is authenticated, the method returns `true`, allowing access to the route. If the user is not authenticated, the method redirects to the login page using the `Router` service and returns `false` to deny access to the route.
To use the `AuthGuard`, you need to configure it in your routing module by adding it to the `canActivate` property of the corresponding route.
